# Data Analysis Examples

From Wes McKinney's Data Analysis for Python textbook, I attempted some of the project exercises. In the above Juptyer notebook there are EDA's for several datasets:

* Bitly .gov dataset

* MovieLens dataset

* United States Baby Names (1880-2010) dataset

* 2012 Political Contributions dataset (unfinished)
